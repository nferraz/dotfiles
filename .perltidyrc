# "Formatting. Indentation. Style. Code layout. Whatever you choose to call it,
# it’s one of the most contentious aspects of programming discipline. More
# and bloodier wars have been fought over code layout than over just about
# any other aspect of coding.
#
# What is the best practice here? Should you use classic Kernighan and Ritchie
# style? Or go with BSD code formatting? Or adopt the layout scheme specified
# by the GNU project? Or conform to the Slashcode coding guidelines?
#
# Of course not! Everyone knows that <insert your personal coding style here>
# is the One True Layout Style, the only sane choice, as ordained by <insert
# your favorite Programming Deity here> since Time Immemorial! Any other
# choice is manifestly absurd, willfully heretical, and self-evidently a
# Work of Darkness!
#
# That’s precisely the problem. When deciding on a layout style, it’s
# hard to decide where rational choices end and rationalized habits begin."
